# 💸 Tip Calculator

A simple Python script that helps you calculate how much each person should pay when splitting a bill — including a tip!

## 🚀 Features

- Input the total bill amount
- Choose a tip percentage (10%, 12%, or 15%)
- Split the bill between any number of people
- See how much each person needs to pay

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The program asks for the **total bill**
2. You choose the **tip percentage**
3. It calculates the **total with tip**
4. It divides the total among the number of people
5. It displays how much **each person should pay**

## 🧪 Example
Welcome to the tip calculator!
What was the total bill? $100
How much percentage tip would u like to give? 10, 12 or 15: 15
How many people to split the bill? 5
Each person will pay: 23.0
